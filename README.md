### First Time Setup
1. **Configure Fields**: Select your preferred farming fields
2. **Set Quest NPCs**: Enable desired quest NPCs
3. **Adjust Safety**: Configure break intervals and randomization
4. **Test Run**: Start with a short test session

## üó∫Ô∏è Field Navigation System

### How Navigation Works
The macro uses BSS's built-in mechanics for efficient field navigation:

1. **Hive Return**: Uses E key (Hive Tool) to instantly return to hive
2. **Character Reset**: Falls back to Roblox character reset if E key fails
3. **Precise Paths**: Pre-calculated movement sequences for each field
4. **Smart Movement**: Automatic jumping on ramps and obstacles

### Supported Fields
All 17 BSS fields are supported with optimized paths:

**Starter Fields:** Sunflower, Dandelion, Mushroom, Blue Flower, Clover
**Intermediate:** Strawberry, Bamboo, Spider
**Advanced:** Rose, Pine Tree, Cactus, Pumpkin
**Expert:** Pineapple, Stump, Coconut, Pepper
**Master:** Mountain Top

### Navigation Features
- **E Key Integration**: Uses BSS's hive tool for instant return
- **Roblox Reset Backup**: Character reset as failsafe method
- **Timed Movement**: Precise movement durations for each field
- **Obstacle Handling**: Automatic jumping for ramps and barriers
- **Path Verification**: Confirms arrival at target field

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Main Settings
- **Farming**: Field selection, rotation, timing
- **Quests**: NPC selection, auto-accept settings
- **Mobs**: Mob types to hunt, detection timeout
- **Planters**: Auto-plant/harvest, field selection
- **Boosts**: Smart boost usage, thresholds
- **Safety**: Randomization, breaks, emergency stops

### Hotkeys (Default)
- `F1`: Start/Stop Macro
- `F2`: Pause/Resume
- `F3`: Emergency Stop
- `F4`: Show/Hide GUI

### Safety Settings
- **Break Intervals**: 30-60 minutes (randomized)
- **Break Duration**: 2-5 minutes (randomized)
- **Movement Randomization**: 30% variance
- **Click Randomization**: 20% variance
- **Emergency Stops**: Multiple failsafe triggers
